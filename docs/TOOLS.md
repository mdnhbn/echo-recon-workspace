# Optional assessment tools / বাইরের টুলের সেটআপ

The dashboard installer installs **only the dashboard**. The eight tools are independent third-party projects with their own licenses, dependencies and update policies. An existing Kali installation usually has several already. Do not move `/usr/bin` files into this project or reinstall working tools unnecessarily.

Dashboard-এর installer শুধু dashboard ইনস্টল করে। আটটি tool আলাদা project। আগে থেকে থাকলে আবার install করার প্রয়োজন নেই। System-এর executable সরাবেন না।

## First check / আগে যাচাই

From the repository folder, as your normal user:

The dashboard's **Download / Setup tools** button lists all eight official sources and this guide. It stays available even when a tool is missing. The **Check installed tools** button refreshes local diagnostics after manual setup; `unverified` means check the version/PATH rather than blindly reinstalling.

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/go/bin:/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH"
.venv/bin/python doctor.py
```

`ready` means the executable's local help/identity check passed; it is not a full functional test or a version security audit. `missing` means not on PATH. `unverified` means identity/help failed. Check the path in the JSON output. No target is contacted by these checks, although third-party programs control their own help/version behavior.

`ready` পুরো পরীক্ষা নয়। `missing` হলে PATH দেখুন। `unverified` হলে ভুল program বা অসমর্থিত version হতে পারে।

## Kali-managed tools

Check available candidates before installing:

```bash
apt-cache policy dnsrecon theharvester nmap subfinder httpx-toolkit arjun nuclei
```

For missing packages, Kali's repository is the simplest managed source. For example:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install dnsrecon theharvester nmap
```

Install only the additional packages your Kali repository actually offers and which you need. Package versions vary with Kali rolling updates; they are not pinned by this application's lock file. We do not download and execute remote installation scripts.

Kali-এর package version সময়ের সঙ্গে বদলায়। এই project-এর `requirements.txt` scanner-গুলোকে pin করে না। কোন package সত্যিই missing তা দেখে install করুন।

## Tool references and compatibility

| Tool | Official source / guidance | Adapter expects |
|---|---|---|
| DNSRecon | [darkoperator/dnsrecon](https://github.com/darkoperator/dnsrecon) | Standard DNS enumeration (`-t std`). |
| Subfinder | [ProjectDiscovery installation](https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/tools/subfinder/install) | Domain input and silent output. |
| HTTPX | [ProjectDiscovery installation](https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/tools/httpx/install) | `-silent`, `-rl`, `-threads`, `-timeout`, `-retries`. |
| Nmap | [Nmap downloads](https://nmap.org/download.html) | TCP connect/service detection, top-port and rate bounds. |
| theHarvester | [laramies/theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester) | `crtsh,otx` sources; service availability can vary. |
| Photon | [s0md3v/Photon](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon) | `photon` launcher, level/thread/delay/output options. |
| Arjun | [s0md3v/Arjun](https://github.com/s0md3v/Arjun) | Rate limit and `--disable-redirects` support. |
| Nuclei | [ProjectDiscovery installation](https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/tools/nuclei/install) | JSONL, redirect-disable, rate/concurrency and excluded-tag flags. |

After a separate installation, click **Check installed tools** again or run `doctor.py`. Restart the dashboard if its inherited PATH changed. The application checks required help flags before using an adapter; unsupported versions are not treated as working. Tests here use controlled responses rather than public scans. Unsupported tool versions may need a reviewed adapter change.

### HTTPX naming collision

Kali may have **Python HTTPX**, an HTTP client, and **ProjectDiscovery HTTPX**, a host probing utility. They are different programs. Kali's `httpx-toolkit` package may expose a differently named executable. This dashboard requires a `httpx` command that identifies as ProjectDiscovery and has the expected flags. Existing user-managed installations in `~/go/bin` can be used by `run.sh`.

Do not overwrite `/usr/bin/httpx` or delete another program to fix the name. If your package exposes `httpx-toolkit`, a normal-user wrapper can map it explicitly:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
command -v httpx-toolkit
```

Only if that command prints a valid installed path, and no file already exists at `~/.local/bin/httpx`, create a wrapper using a text editor:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/bin/httpx-toolkit "$@"
```

Save as `~/.local/bin/httpx`, check that the actual executable path matches your system, then `chmod +x ~/.local/bin/httpx`. Restart and recheck. If a wrapper already exists, inspect it instead of replacing it.

Python HTTPX মুছবেন না বা `/usr/bin` overwrite করবেন না। আলাদা user wrapper দিয়ে সঠিক tool নির্বাচন করা যায়।

### Photon isolated environment (when Kali does not provide it)

Use a separate tool directory and a separate virtual environment. Select and review an upstream commit first; do not blindly run an unknown script. The following downloads source into a new folder and installs its Python dependencies. It does not execute a scan:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Tools/02-Custom
cd ~/Tools/02-Custom
git clone https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon.git photon-source
cd photon-source
git rev-parse HEAD
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Record the commit and review dependency changes before updating. Photon dependencies above are upstream-managed and are **not** covered by the dashboard's hash lock. If you already have a working Photon launcher, keep it. Otherwise create `~/.local/bin/photon` in your editor, without overwriting an existing file:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
exec "$HOME/Tools/02-Custom/photon-source/.venv/bin/python" "$HOME/Tools/02-Custom/photon-source/photon.py" "$@"
```

Make it executable with `chmod +x ~/.local/bin/photon`. `doctor.py` should now identify Photon. Run it as a normal user. Crawlers may follow redirects; explicit dashboard inputs are not a strict egress guarantee.

### Templates and data providers

Nuclei needs templates installed separately using its official instructions. This dashboard does not auto-download updates, provision third-party API keys or enable out-of-band interaction. Do not paste API keys into the dashboard or commit them. Template coverage and source-provider availability affect results; missing templates/errors must be reviewed, not interpreted as a clean assessment.

নতুন template, API account বা secret এই dashboard নিজে তৈরি করে না। কোনো key GitHub-এ upload করবেন না।
